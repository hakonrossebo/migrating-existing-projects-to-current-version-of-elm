# Migrating existing projects to current version of Elm


> A community driven list helping coordinate the effort of upgrading (mostly unmaintained) Elm projects.

> There are many Elm projects that has been created for previous versions of Elm.
People learning/coming into Elm find many outdated projects that would be very useful to have running on the current version of Elm (0.17.1).
By maintaining this and upgrading projects, I hope that we could help the Elm community having up-to-date code.

>How can I contribute?
* Find a project in this list and start contributing to the upgrade by creating pull requests and issues on the respective projects. Tips on upgrading here: [Upgrade howto links](#upgrade-howto-links). If you start upgrading a project, please submit an issue so that we can update the status in this list.
* If a project has moved to a new location, or if the maintainers are not responding to issues/pull requests - please create an issue and create a pull request notifying that the project is abandoned/moved to a new location. Other people navigating to these projects will be able to see the PR/issue and find the updated projects.
* This list is not complete. If you know other projects that should be added/modified? Feel free to contribute to this list by either subitting issues or pull requests (see [List item template](#template)).
