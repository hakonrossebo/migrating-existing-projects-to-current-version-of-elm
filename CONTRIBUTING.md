# Contribution Guidelines

>How can I contribute?
* Find a project in this list and start contributing to the upgrade by creating pull requests and issues on the respective projects. Tips on upgrading here: [Upgrade howto links](#upgrade-howto-links). If you start upgrading a project, please submit an issue so that we can update the status in this list.
* If a project has moved to a new location, or if the maintainers are not responding to issues/pull requests - please create an issue and create a pull request notifying that the project is abandoned/moved to a new location. Other people navigating to these projects will be able to see the PR/issue and find the updated projects.
* This list is not complete. If you know other projects that should be added/modified? Feel free to contribute to this list by either subitting issues or pull requests (see [List item template](#template)).


Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each project/list item.
- Use the provided template (see below) to any list items
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your contributions!
